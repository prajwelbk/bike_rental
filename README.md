## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new marke


## Conclusions
- The variables that have an impact on the bike-sharing system are as follows
    - Year 
    - Working Day
    - Wind Speed 
    - Spring,Winter Season(s)
    - October, September Month(s)
    - Saturday
    - Light Rain/Thunderstorm, Misty Weather
- The impact of these variables can be assessed using the below formula
    - cnt = 0.5128 + (0.2456)yr + (0.0630)workingday + (-0.1116)windspeed +(-0.2866)spring+(-0.0966)winter+(0.1130)Oct+(0.0812)Sep+(0.0670)Saturday+(-0.3205)Light Rain/Thunderstorm+(-0.0806)Misty
- The analysis shows that wind speed, winter season, spring season, Rainy and misty weathers have a negative impact on the bike sharing platform.
- Whereas working days have a positive impact.
- The number of users using the platform is high on October and September months and Saturdays.
